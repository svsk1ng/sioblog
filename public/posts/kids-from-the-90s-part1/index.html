Those were the glorious days of the 90s when our idea of fun was kicking around a football or lounging in the park until our knees were caked in dirt. Back then, the concept of a smart mobile device was as alien to us as space travel. We communicated with our friends through landlines, and, remarkably, I can still recite most of their phone numbers from memory. Even today, we remain a close-knit group, a testament to the enduring bonds forged in those simpler times.\nOne vivid memory stands out from my childhood, a day when I returned home from school and my father brought a special package from my uncle in Canada. We unwrapped it with great care, revealing a large, gray, brick-like device. My father promptly headed to the living room and embarked on the task of connecting this mysterious contraption to our television. I watched in awe as he plugged it into the TV antenna input. When he pushed the “ON” button, my eyes widened with wonder. A tiny red character appeared on the screen, jumping and maneuvering through virtual obstacles. Yes, my uncle had gifted us a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).\nBefore the NES era, my grandfather, now a spry 86 years old, shared in our gaming adventures. Our very first gaming console was an Atari with the game Arkanoid, and to this day, he continues to play a bubble shooter game on a slightly battered PSP. This, in essence, is the brief tale of how I embarked on my journey into the world of gaming at a remarkably young age. Stay tuned for Part 2, where I’ll delve deeper into my gaming adventures and the evolution of this fascinating hobby.\n",
