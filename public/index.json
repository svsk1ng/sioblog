[{"content":"We live in the modern age of didital data exploitation. Big tech companies are trying to make big profits from users data and targeted-advertising. Our privacy and security is at a critical stage and everyone shall try to be more alerted of what information are exposing to the web. For starters, let me explain the difference between privacy and security from my prespective.\nPrivacy is the assurance that your data is only seen by the parties you itent to view it. For example, we communicate with friends through an end-to-end encrypted chat application. We must be sure that the message has been only seen by us and the recepient (in this case our friend).\nSecurity is the assurance that your data has not been altered during transmittion.\nIn many instances, while data is being transmitted, major technology corporations typically gather the metadata from our messages for the purpose of advertising. This stands out as a primary rationale for why safeguarding our privacy is imperative. Privacy fundamentally pertains to the data about individuals, and this becomes significant because we understand that possessing such information bestows authority over individuals. If we are concerned about our capacity to lead genuine, gratifying, and unrestricted lives as human beings, we need to give attention to the regulations that pertain to data concerning us. A significant portion of our contemporary society is organized around data. Whenever you engage in online shopping, peruse the news, conduct research, cast your vote, seek directions, or indeed any other activity, you are reliant on data. If we reside in a society that is defined by data, then the data related to us is of consequence, and therefore, the concept of privacy holds significance.\n","permalink":"https://savvas.live/posts/why-privacy-and-security-matters/","summary":"We live in the modern age of didital data exploitation.

Those were the glorious days of the 90s when our idea of fun was kicking around a football or lounging in the park until our knees were caked in dirt. Back then, the concept of a smart mobile device was as alien to us as space travel. We communicated with our friends through landlines, and, remarkably, I can still recite most of their phone numbers from memory. Even today, we remain a close-knit group, a testament to the enduring bonds forged in those simpler times.\nOne vivid memory stands out from my childhood, a day when I returned home from school and my father brought a special package from my uncle in Canada. We unwrapped it with great care, revealing a large, gray, brick-like device. My father promptly headed to the living room and embarked on the task of connecting this mysterious contraption to our television. I watched in awe as he plugged it into the TV antenna input. When he pushed the \u0026ldquo;ON\u0026rdquo; button, my eyes widened with wonder. A tiny red character appeared on the screen, jumping and maneuvering through virtual obstacles. Yes, my uncle had gifted us a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).\nBefore the NES era, my grandfather, now a spry 86 years old, shared in our gaming adventures. Our very first gaming console was an Atari with the game Arkanoid, and to this day, he continues to play a bubble shooter game on a slightly battered PSP. This, in essence, is the brief tale of how I embarked on my journey into the world of gaming at a remarkably young age. Stay tuned for Part 2, where I\u0026rsquo;ll delve deeper into my gaming adventures and the evolution of this fascinating hobby.\n","permalink":"https://savvas.live/posts/kids-from-the-90s-part1/","summary":"I fondly recall my childhood, a time when I rushed home from school only to dash out again to join my friends in the neighborhood for hours of unbridled play.
