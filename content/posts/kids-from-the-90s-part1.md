I remembered getting home from school just to get out and play with friends in the neighborhood. Yes that's what we used to do back in the 90s. Playing football or just sitting around the park and getting our knees dirty. We had no idea what a mobile device was back in the early 90s. We used to call our friends using landlines. I can still remember most of the phone numbers of my friends and yes we still hang around together till this day :) .<br><br>
I cannot forget one day when i got home from school, my dad brought home a package from my uncle who used to work in Canada. We unwrapped it carefully and i saw a big grey plastic brick-like device. My dad then went to the living room and started working in installing this device on the TV. I can remember him connecting the device to the TV antenna input. After he finished the installation and pushed the device buttton, my eyes started to sparkle. I could see a red little character moving and jumping around inside the TV screen. Yes, my uncle bought us a NES.
idea feel very lucky growing up in the 90s.
