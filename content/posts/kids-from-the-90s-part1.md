I remembered getting home from school just to get out and play with friends in the neighborhood. Yes that's what we used to do back in the 90s. Playing football or just sitting around the park and getting our knees dirty. We had no idea what a smart mobile device was back in the early 90s. We used to get in touch our friends over landlines. I can still remember most of the phone numbers of my friends and yes we still hang around together till this day :) .<br>


I remember one day when i got home from school, my dad brought home a package from my uncle who used to work in Canada. We unwrapped it carefully and i saw a big grey plastic brick-like device. My dad then went to the living room and started working in installing this device on the TV. I can remember him connecting the device to the TV antenna input. After he finished the installation and pushed the device "ON" buttton, my eyes started to sparkle. I could see a red little character moving and jumping around inside the TV screen. Yes, my uncle bought us a NES. <br>

Prior NES, my grandfather who is now 86, used to play video games with us. Our first console ever was an Atari with Arcanoid. He still plays a bubble shooter game on a cracked PSP. <br>
Thats a very short story on how i stepped into gaming from a very young age. Will update this article on Part 2.
